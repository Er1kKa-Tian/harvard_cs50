Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Brazil will win.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000. Below this number, we can scale up the simulation without sacrifising much running time. On the other hand, if we further increase the scale of simulations above 10000, the time used will incrase approximately one-to-one to the factor by which we scale up.
