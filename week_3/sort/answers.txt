sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: It uses an approximately same time to sort random/reversed numbers, but uses a very short time to sort sorted numbers. The only algorithm whose sorting time will vary, given a fixed amount of numbers, is bubble sort.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It spents an approximately same amount of time (very short) to sort random/reversed/sorted numbers.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: It spents a significantly longer time to sort sorted numbers, which is a feature of selection sort. Omega(n^2)
